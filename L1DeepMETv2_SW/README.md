# L1DeepMetv2-GoldenC: A C++ and Python-Compatible Implementation of the L1DeepMETv2 Model for MET Regression
This repository provides a C++ implementation of the [L1DeepMETv2](https://github.com/DeepMETv2/L1DeepMETv2/tree/3f6ea5777704cfe7ed64f847f9be8735594484cc) model, originally developed in PyTorch. The L1DeepMETv2 model leverages Edge Convolutional Networks (EdgeConv) to regress MET (Missing Transverse Energy) from L1Puppi candidates in particle physics data. In addition to a high-performance C++ implementation, this "Golden C" version offers Python bindings, allowing seamless integration of the C++ model as a Python module.

Key features of this repository include:

- A C++ implementation faithfully replicating the structure and performance of the original L1DeepMETv2 PyTorch model.
- Python bindings that enable users to interact with the C++ model directly in Python, preserving the familiar interface and usage from the original PyTorch codebase.
- Efficient model inference, suitable for both C++ and Python environments, especially where Python's performance limitations might be a concern.

## Setup
- use ```git clone --recurse-submodules``` to clone this repository
- ~~Change the activation function from sigmoid to relu in L1DeepMETv2/model/net.py by toggling the comments for lines 29 and 30~~
- Create a conda environment and install pybind11 ``` conda create -n "myenv"``` followed by ```pip install pybind11```
- ~~Follow the [README](https://github.com/DeepMETv2/L1DeepMETv2/tree/3f6ea5777704cfe7ed64f847f9be8735594484cc#) for L1DeepMETv2 to produce a dataset in L1DeepMETv2/data_ttbar in the conda environment~~
- In the L1DeepMETv2 submodule, ```cd``` to ```data_delphes``` and unpack the data as ```tar -xzvf processed.tar.gz```
- Run the following build command to create the CPython Binding: ```g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++17 -fPIC `python3 -m pybind11 --includes` binding.cpp GraphMetNetwork.cpp -o graphmetnetwork`python3-config --extension-suffix```

## Development
- Use the evaluate.ipynb notebook as a tutorial to load both the Pytorch and C++ Binding models in a python notebook environment. 
- This tutorial uses a random test data point from the test dataloader to run inference on both the pytorch and c++ model. Feel free to run the entire dataloader or your own custom dataloader
